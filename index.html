                    Hi! I'm Juan, a recent computer science graduate from SFSU. I enjoy learning
                    about new technologies both in my field of study and outside. I like the 
                    challenge of learning new concepts and ideas simply for the sake of knowledge,
                    as trite as that may seem. I look forward to joining a professional team and
                    making a positive impact by contributing with my skills.
                </p>
